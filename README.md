This repo contains some files archived from the ex-Wind River employees Yahoo group knowns as WindX.

I omitted the ones with personal photos since this is a public repo (okay I figured there's no harm in having the office map). 
If you have an non-PII containing files you think are suitable for the public eye just submit a PR.  

Feel free to link to stuff in this repo - I'm never going to delete it so it'll last as long as Github lasts. Ironically it's part of Microsoft now of course.

Regards, 

Simon (WindX creator circa 2001)
