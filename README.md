This repo contains some files archived from the ex-Wind River employees Yahoo group knowns as WindX.

I omitted the ones with personal photos since this is a public repo (okay I figured there's no harm in having the office map). 
If you have an non-PII containing files you think are suitable for the public eye just submit a PR.  

Feel free to link to stuff in this repo - I'm never going to delete it so it'll last as long as Github lasts. Ironically it's part of Microsoft now of course.

Finally if you're a WindX-er and looking to find your old Wind River buddies I suggest you head on over to LinkedIn which has over 1,700 current and former
Wind River emps in their system: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wind-river/ And if you're feeling nostalgic there's a potted history of Wind River Systems
on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_River_Systems

Simon (WindX creator circa 2001)
